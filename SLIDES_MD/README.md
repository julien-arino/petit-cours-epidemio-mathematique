# Slides

These are the `Markdown` files (including `LaTeX`) required to generate the slides for the different components of the course. Note that they are, at the time of writing, work in progress. They contain typos and are not even complete. I will indicate here when the material for a given lecture is closer to being ready.

The slides are generated using [Marp](https://marp.app/).
