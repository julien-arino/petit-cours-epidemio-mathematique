# ABM $\neq$ IBM

- Early in the life of these models, they were called IBM (individual-based models)
- Over the years, a "philosophical" distinction has emerged:
  - IBM are mathematical models that consider individuals as the units; e.g., DTMC, CTMC, branching processes, etc.
  - ABM are computational models whose study is, for the most part, only possible numerically

# ABM vs Network models

- Network models endow vertices with simple systems and couple them through graphs
- Can be ABM, but some networks can also be studied analytically
- Not enough time to go into this, a very interesting subject!
